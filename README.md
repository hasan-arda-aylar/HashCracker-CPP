# HashCracker-CPP
A simple C++ hash cracking tool

HashCracker is a simple command-line tool written in C++ that attempts to crack
cryptographic hash values using a wordlist-based brute-force approach.

The project uses OpenSSL's EVP interface and currently supports SHA-1, SHA-256,
and SHA-512 hashing algorithms. It is intended for educational and learning
purposes only.
